- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NinjaDuckie; most people call me Duckie, almost everybody drops the Ninja.

- ðŸ‘€ I've got interests in almost every arm of the arts and sciences, from vague to detailed.
    - I'm reasonably accomplished with musical instruments and music production
    - I love the theatre and (some) opera
    - I'm a Creative Writing degree holder working on too many projects
    - I have a fascination for classical art
    - I'm very interested in game development

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and I may never stop.

- ðŸ“« You can't reach me right now. Too much to do! Not enough time.
